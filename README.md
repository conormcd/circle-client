# CircleCI JS Client

A JavaScript client for CircleCI's [v2 API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/).

## Usage

### Setup

First, go and get a CircleCI [API Token](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens).

Then all you need to do is import the client class and instantiate it with your token and optionally a project slug and default branch:

```ts
import CircleCI from 'circle-client';

const client = new CircleCI(
  '2c818264d2557cd14b9fc3fa538df6ecbc6489f3',
  // this could also be "github/owner/repo"
  ['github', 'owner', 'repo'],
  {
    // methods that take a branch arg can override this
    branch: 'main',
  }
);
```

Your project slug consists of:
- The VCS provider (either `github` or `bitbucket`)
- The project's owner (e.g. your username or organization name)
- The repo name

### Methods

Below is a summary list of available methods. Check out the main [client file](./src/client.ts) for fully-typed method signatures.

**Paginated results**: any method that begins with `list` returns a `Paged<T>` object, with an `items` property containing the API results, and a `next_page_token` property. If `next_page_token` is set, you can use it to call the method again with the `pageToken` argument set to that value to retrieve the next page of results.

- `getJob` - Returns job details.
- `cancelJob` - Cancel job with a given job number.
- `listJobArtifacts` - Returns a job's artifacts.
- `listJobTests` - Get test metadata for a build.

### Errors

In addition to [Fetch errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#Checking_that_the_fetch_was_successful), the following errors can occur:

- Any method that relies on a project slug will throw a `ProjectSlugError` if one is not set when the method is called.
- When an API call is made, if the response status code does not equal the success code indicated for that endpoint in API documentation, an `APIError` will be thrown. The object contains a `message` (which might be generated by the client or the API), `status`, and the `response` object of the Fetch request.
- A method may throw `ArgumentError` if an invalid set of arguments is provided that cannot be caught by TypeScript.

## Development

Development is pretty straightforward:

- Run `yarn build` to generate a new distribution build.
- `yarn lint` and `yarn format` are also available and do exactly what they say.

### Testing

Run tests:

- `yarn test` (optionally with `--watchAll`)

Run the CircleCI test job locally:

- Download the [CircleCI CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#installation)
- If you're changing the config, validate your changes: `circleci config validate`
- Generate a local config file: `circleci config process .circleci/config.yml > .circleci/local.yml`
- Execute the test job: `circleci local execute -c .circleci/local.yml --job test`
